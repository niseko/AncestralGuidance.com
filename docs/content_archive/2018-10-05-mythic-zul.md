# Mythic Mechanics


Like many other fights in Uldir, there are very few changes to Zul on mythic that impact healers.  The only one that really matters is the [Pool of Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273361/pool-of-darkness) applying stacks of [Corrupted Blood](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=274195/corrupted-blood).  This means you will need to add a little more priority healing to people who are soaking [Pool of Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273361/pool-of-darkness).  As a shaman you may need to [purge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=370/purge) [Decaying Flesh](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=276434/decaying-flesh) off an add to force it onto another add to permanently kill an add.  The jump order for [Decaying Flesh](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=276434/decaying-flesh) is always Crawg to Bloodhexer to Crusher.


# Suggested Talents


![](http://ancestralguidance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MZek.png)

The second phase of Zul is the only healing intensive phase so look to take the standard AoE healing talents.  You could take [NG](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=30884/natures-guardian) over [GS](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192088/graceful-spirit) if you aren't having to move much in the last phase.


# Notable Azerite Traits


Look for any traits that improve AoE healing.  [Overflowing Shores](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278095/overflowing-shores), [Sprouting Spirits](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=279504/spouting-spirits), and [Swelling Stream](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275488/swelling-stream) are all excellent choices to fulfill the need of AoE healing.  [Ancestral Resonance](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=277926/ancestral-resonance) has potential on this fight if someone else can use [Bloodlust](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2825/bloodlust) / [Heroism](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=32182/heroism) on pull so you can get a large mastery buff in the final phase where healing actually matters.  [Ebb and Flow](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273597/ebb-and-flow) has potential since the entire raid is stacked in the final phase.


# Mythic Healing Tips





 	
  * DPS as much as possible in phase 1.

 	
  * Time [Wellspring](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=197995/wellspring) with [Dark Revelation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273365/dark-revelation)s in phase 1.

 	
  * Keep [Healing Rain](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73920/healing-rain) down 100% in phase 2.

 	
  * Drop [EWT](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=198838/earthen-wall-totem) as soon as you enter phase 2 and use it on cooldown.

 	
  * Don't worry too much about mana management since this fight is so short.
