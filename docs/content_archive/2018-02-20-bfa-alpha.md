  * [Tremor Totem](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=8143/tremor-totem) is back, removing Fear, Charm and Sleep effects from party and raid members.

  * **Row 30**

 	
    * This row was moved to Row 75

 	
    * [Gust of Wind](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=192063/gust-of-wind) is replaced by [Nature's Guardian](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=30884/natures-guardian), giving you a defensive instead of mobility.

 	
      * [Nature's Guardian](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=30884/natures-guardian) appears to be stronger than initially thought, with it being able to save you from oneshots. If you get hit for 50% of your HP at 40%, it will actually proc and save you.

 	
      * It appears to not proc if you fall below 35% health, but only after you receive a hit being below 35% which probably is not intended like that.







 	
  * **Row 45 **

 	
    * Replacing [Lightning Surge Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=192058/lightning-surge-totem) is [Static Charge](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=265046/static-charge) reducing the CD of the totem depending on how many targets you hit with it, so it can potentially go down to a 40 second cooldown. Stun duration got reduced from 5 to 3 seconds.

 	
    * [Voodoo Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=196932/voodoo-totem) removed, replaced by [Spirit Wolf](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=260878/spirit-wolf)

 	
      * This is essentially [Ghost in the Mist](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=207351/ghost-in-the-mist) from the artifact weapon and likely will be the go-to in this row for raids, as damage reduction and movement speed are always very useful. The effect stacks up to 20% movement speed and damage reduction, and lasts until you leave the Ghost Wolf form.







 	
  * **Row 60 **

 	
    * This Row was moved to Row 30

 	
    * [Crashing Waves](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=197464/crashing-waves) has been replaced by [Echo of the Elements](https://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=108283/echo-of-the-elements)

 	
      * Echo has lost the 10% chance to gain a charge of riptide but now allows two charges of CBT if talented.




 	
    * [Ancestral Guidance](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108281/ancestral-guidance) is removed, replaced by [Earth Shield](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=974/earth-shield)

 	
      * Ancestral Guidance was always a way stronger option than the other 2, being able to combine it with Cloudburst was a great interaction, and it buffed the weak point of the Ascendance cooldown -> the range. Seeing this gone is odd as it felt like an integral part of the toolkit, working well with just about everything and in any situation. I would have rather seen a balance of the row power wise than a straight up removal, as this combined with the Cloudburst changes it feels like a lot of depth of the class is gone.

 	
      * Earth Shield, an old shaman ability that many welcome back with open arms. However in its current Alpha form its nothing more than another, weaker,  [Riptide](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=61295/riptide) with a minimum duration of 27 seconds (3 seconds internal cooldown on the heal) and limited to 1 target at a time. The 19th April Alpha build gave it a 10% healing bonus for you on its target, if thats enough to make it good is hard to say.

 	
        * [Earth Shield](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=974/earth-shield) currently seems to affect some abilities differently, increasing [Chain Heal](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1064/chain-heal) initial (but not the bounces) by 30%, the [Riptide](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=61295/riptide) initial by 30% but the hot by 10%. It also does not affect [HST](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=5394/healing-stream-totem) or [HTT](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108280/healing-tide-totem) at all, which is most likely a bug. Everything else is 10%.










 	
  * **Row 75 **

 	
    * This Row was moved to Row 60

 	
    * [Earth Shield Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=198838/earthen-shield-totem) renamed to [Earth Wall Totem](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=198838/earthen-wall-totem)

 	
      * I doubt this will have any gameplay changes, but i still expect that people will complain about this change.







 	
  * **Row 90**

 	
    * [Bottomless Depths](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=197467/bottomless-depths) removed

 	
      * Replaced by [Downpour](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=207778/downpour). No, this is not the tier-set even though it has the same name, it actually is [Gift of the Queen](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=207778/gift-of-the-queen).




 	
    * [Cloudburst Totem](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=157153/cloudburst-totem) now <del>only collects effective healing instead of all healing, also</del> replaces [HST](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=5394/healing-stream-totem) when talented

 	
      * The 19th April build reverted this to take all healing again, the loss of [AG](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108281/ancestral-guidance) and [HST](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=5394/healing-stream-totem) still hits it very hard and we will need raid testing to find out how viable it is.




 	
    * [Flash Flood](https://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=280614/flash-flood) is a new talent that reduces the cast speed of your next healing spell by 20% after consuming a stack of [Tidal Waves](https://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=51564/tidal-waves).

 	
      * This allows us to have [QA](https://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=207285/queen-ascendant) in a talent that is more controllable and works on all healing spell casts instead of just direct healing spells.







 	
  * **Row 100 **

 	
    * [Ascendance](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=114052/ascendance)

 	
      * While this spell didn't get any changes, it will get hit hard by the removal of [Ancestral Guidance](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108281/ancestral-guidance). What makes this spell strong in raids is especially the combination with Ancestral Guidance taking Ascendances healing and overhealing, and distributing it over 40 yards - not to mention what both those spells provide towards Cloudburst. However it will still have a great spot in dungeons.










# The Heart of Azeroth


Replacing the artifact weapon with traits, Netherlight Crucible and also tier sets is a new system, called the Heart of Azeroth. There is not a lot of information on it yet, and a lof of the information we do have is based on speculation. However it looks like that if you pick a trait, you can not change it.

How an azerite piece looks like:

![](http://ancestralguidance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/azeritepiece-276x300.jpg)

However some of the traits for Shaman have shown up in the alpha builds, keep in mind that all of the numbers are placeholders:



 	
  * Restoration Shaman

 	
    * [Astral Shift](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=263786/astral-shift)

 	
    * [Serene Spirit](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=274823/serene-spirit)

 	
    * [Ancestral Reach](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=263790/ancestral-reach)

 	
    * [Soothing Waters](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=272989/soothing-waters)

 	
    * [Embrace of the Tides](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=264123/embrace-of-the-tides)

 	
    * [Healing Way](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=269567)

 	
    * [Ebb and Flow](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=273597/ebb-and-flow)

 	
    * [Swelling Stream](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=275488/swelling-stream)




 	
  * General

 	
    * [Woundbinder](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=267880/woundbinder)

 	
    * [Resounding Protection](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=263962/resounding-protection)

 	
    * [Volcanic Lightning](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=272978/volcanic-lightning)

 	
    * [Champion of Azeroth](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=270583/champion-of-azeroth)





[Azerite Piece](http://bfa.wowhead.com/item=159903/mail-of-the-champion?azerite-powers=7) - Example Azerite piece, click on it to open the calculator

Overall the changes feel unbalanced, taking away a lot of power and depth but not adding anything in as replacements. Keep in mind that a lot of our current interesting stuff is in the artifact, which haven't made it into the alpha (yet?), such as



 	
  * <del>[Gift of the Queen](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=207778/gift-of-the-queen)</del> - Got added as a talent under the name of [Downpour](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=207778/downpour) on April 19th

 	
  * [Cumulative Upkeep](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=207362/cumulative-upkeep)

 	
  * <del>[Queen Ascendant](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=207285/queen-ascendant)</del> - The talent [Flash Flood](https://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=280614/flash-flood) replaces QA as a talent on May 31st.

 	
  * [Sense of Urgency](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=207355/sense-of-urgency)


Obviously power has always be compared to other classes, and i don't doubt that they can tune us in a way where the throughput is not lacking, however my concerns are that we could feel bland and lose a lot of possible min-maxing.Mastery is still another concern, being severely behind the other stats in power even even when you weight low-health healing higher, the issue is mostly the linear scaling - a possible fix for this could be to have it start off stronger at higher HP levels but be the same as its currently is at 0% HP.
