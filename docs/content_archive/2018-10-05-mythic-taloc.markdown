# Mythic Mechanics


On mythic difficulty, Taloc gains two new abilities: [Hardened Arteries](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275189/hardened-arteries) and [Enlarged Heart](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275205/enlarged-heart).  These abilities are active during phases 1 and 3.  Both of these abilities are cast at the same time.  When Taloc casts these abilities, 10 raid members will be afflicted by [Hardened Arteries](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275189/hardened-arteries) which gradually slows players until it fully roots them.  After being fully rooted, each player explodes dealing damage to all allies within 8 yards.  Anyone not afflicted by [Hardened Arteries](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275189/hardened-arteries) is expected to soak [Enlarged Heart](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275205/enlarged-heart).  [Enlarged Heart](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275205/enlarged-heart) will always select a tank as the primary target.  Try to take [Hardened Arteries](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275189/hardened-arteries) to the outside of the room and leave the center of the room as a place to soak the [Enlarged Heart](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275205/enlarged-heart).

A few mechanics from heroic are changed in mythic as well.  Firstly, [Sanguine Static](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272582/sanguine-static) shoots out 5 bolts rather than 3.  While on the elevator ride down, there are two [Uldir Defense Beam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=268245/uldir-defensive-beam)s rather than one.  The beams can either cross, or be parallel to each other for each set of beams.


# Suggested Talents

Talent selection on Taloc does not change with increasing difficulty.  You could consider taking [Earthen Wall Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=198838/earthen-wall-totem) if you want to pad meters by using it on [Cudgel of Gore](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=271296/cudgel-of-gore) casts or on [Enlarged Heart](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275205/enlarged-heart) damage events.


# Notable Azerite Traits


The only trait that has increased value on Taloc is [Sprouting Spirits](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=279504/spouting-spirits).  Due to the mostly stacked, and bursty nature of the fight, [Sprouting Spirits](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=279504/spouting-spirits) adds an extra cooldown available for [Cudgel of Gore](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=271296/cudgel-of-gore).  [Swelling Stream](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275488/swelling-stream) is always a good option for increased raid healing.


# Mythic Healing Tips





 	
  * Try to line up [Wellspring](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=197995/wellspring) and Downpour casts with [Cudgel of Gore](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=271296/cudgel-of-gore) casts.

 	
  * Use [Downpour](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=207778/downpour) on [Enlarged Heart](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275205/enlarged-heart) damage events if needed.

 	
  * Focus people who are targeted by [Plasma Discharge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=271222/plasma-discharge).
