In this article I’m going to go over talents, legendaries, and general tips for Restoration Shamans to do in [mythic+](http://www.wowhead.com/item=138019/mythic-keystone) dungeons. I’m not going to go in-depth over every dungeon but I will make note of certain times where talents or legendaries are much better due in a particular dungeon.

To begin, a quick rundown of how to heal in Mythic+ dungeons for a beginner.



 	
  * Single target healing spells are going to be your predominant way of healing people.  Typically you will want to use [Healing Surge](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=8004/healing-surge) as your main source of healing and generate [tidal waves](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=51564/tidal-waves) using [riptide](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=61295/riptide). [Chain Heal](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1064/chain-heal) is usually not a good button to press.

 	
  * You’ll have multiple times to use cooldowns so space them out and use them as needed.  Currently in Legion we have many cooldowns that can be rotated through on trash or used simultaneously on dangerous packs of mobs.

 	
  * Try to use T21 4 set bonus and use it well.  This means keep [Healing Rain](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=73920/healing-rain) down as much as possible on targets that will be taking damage and make sure people understand your throughput is massively increased by standing in it.  This being said, make sure you are putting Healing Rain in good places for your group members to stand in.

 	
  * DPS as much as possible during healing downtime,  your damage matters quite a bit as you push higher levels.  Don’t be afraid to use trinkets that enhance your ability to do damage if you can afford to and remember that your first priority is to heal, then damage.

 	
  * We have a ton of utility available to us including an AoE stun, an interrupt, and massive amounts of health increases and damage reductions.  [Lightning Surge totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=192058/lightning-surge-totem) and [Wind Shear](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=57994/wind-shear) have most of their use on trash while most survivability increases are more useful on bosses




# Talents


For most people talents are pretty rigid since we are focusing more on single target healing. Typical talent builds include these talents.

![](http://ancestralguidance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mythicdungeontalent.png)
15

99.9% of the time you want to go with [Undulation](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=200071/undulation). The only time you should swap off this talent is if you are doing keys that are far below the difficulty your group is capable of.

30

Anything in this row works. A good choice is usually [Gust of Wind](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=192063/gust-of-wind) since it can be used to access certain routes in dungeons that allow you to skip harder trash pulls or to dodge projectile mechanics.

45

[Lightning Surge Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=192058/lightning-surge-totem) is the default choice here since a 5 second AoE stun is very useful in almost any dungeon.  You can also use [Earthgrab Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=51485/earthgrab-totem) if your group wants an AoE root.

60

This row causes a lot of debate among Shamans. [Crashing Waves](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=197464/crashing-waves) is quite effective in Mythic+ due to the number of casts of riptides and maintaining high uptime on [Tidal Waves](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=51564/tidal-waves). This will give you high output when single target healing. On the other hand, [Ancestral Guidance](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108281/ancestral-guidance) is very strong when used in combination with [Ascendance](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=114052/ascendance). You can easily top your group in 1-2 globals. Even when used alone, it still does a decent amount of healing and can allow you to DPS to heal.

75

[Ancestral Vigor](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=207401/ancestral-vigor) is the most widely used talent in this row since it is quite easy to apply it to all 5 group members before a large burst of damage as well as it having no cooldown when compared to [Ancestral Protection Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=207399/ancestral-protection-totem). On the other hand with the changes to Mythic+ in 7.3.5 with the battlerez timer change, Ancestral Protection Totem can be very useful if you can predict someone dying.

90

[Echo of the Elements](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108283/echo-of-the-elements) is almost mandatory in Mythic+ since it not only allows us to bank up charges of [Riptide ](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=61295/riptide)and [Healing Stream Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=5394/healing-stream-totem), but is the only talent we can take to improve our DPS. If choosing to use the [Soul of the Farseer](http://www.wowhead.com/item=151647/soul-of-the-farseer&bonus=3630) legendary, take [Cloudburst Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=157153/cloudburst-totem) to go alongside with Echo.

100

[Ascendance](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=114052/ascendance) is really the only choice in this tier due to [High Tide](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=157154/high-tide) and [Wellspring](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=197995/wellspring) not being useful at all in dungeons. This also allows us to have an extra healing cooldown for when things go poorly.


# Affixes


Now, let’s go over what affixes are going to affect us while healing in [mythic plus](http://www.wowhead.com/item=138019/mythic-keystone) dungeons. The only things that alter our playstyle are the level 4+ and level 7+ affixes as [Tyrannical](http://www.wowhead.com/affix=9/tyrannical) and [Fortified](http://www.wowhead.com/affix=10/fortified) are just damage and health multipliers for bosses and trash respectively.

LEVEL 4

For this category the two notable affixes are [Raging](http://www.wowhead.com/affix=6/raging) and [Bursting](http://www.wowhead.com/affix=11/bursting).

When [Raging](http://www.wowhead.com/affix=6/raging) is applied to the key be sure to keep a close eye on the tank as well as any other damage that the group can take once mobs are [enrage](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=178658/enrage)d. This means saving [Capacitor Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=192058/lightning-surge-totem) as well as having [Wind Shear](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=57994/wind-shear) available for mobs that need to be cc’d or interrupted.

[Bursting](http://www.wowhead.com/affix=11/bursting) can be very easy to deal with, or a nightmare if your group decides to constantly refresh the debuff. There are a few ways you can counter high stacks of [bursting](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=240443/burst). First is using [Spirit Link Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=98008/spirit-link-totem) in combination with [Ascendance](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=114052/ascendance) and/or [Ancestral Guidance](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108281/ancestral-guidance) and healing the lowest maximum health person in your group. This is because [Bursting](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=240443/burst) does % max health damage and Spirit Link redistributes based on % of health pools. Another way is to use damage reductions as a group and rotate through the group single target healing group members to conserve healing cooldowns for another point in the near future.

LEVEL 7

These affixes are a bit more tricky. The ones that affect us most in this category are [Necrotic](http://bfa.wowhead.com/affix=4/necrotic), [Quaking](http://www.wowhead.com/affix=14/quaking) and [Grievous](http://www.wowhead.com/affix=12/grievous).

[Quaking](http://www.wowhead.com/affix=14/quaking) is by far the easiest of these, but you need to make sure you don’t cast healing spells as [quake](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=240447/quake) is going off, since being locked out of casting nature spells for a prolonged period of time can easily cause deaths.

[Necrotic](http://bfa.wowhead.com/affix=4/necrotic) is a tricky affix to deal with since your tank will be taking reduced healing. Past 33 stacks of [necrotic](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=209858/necrotic-rot) the tank will be unhealable. One way to still be able to heal your tank through high necrotic stacks is using [Spirit Link Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=98008/spirit-link-totem) and healing other members of your group stood inside the Spirit Link. The health redistribution of the totem ignores the healing reduction caused by [necrotic](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=209858/necrotic-rot).

[Grievous](http://www.wowhead.com/affix=12/grievous) can be the hardest affix to deal with or the easiest if handled properly. The most important thing to do when healing targets bleeding out from [Grievous](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=240559/grievous-wound) is to focus on getting one target out of Grievous range then working on the next player. If you try to continuously fight against 5 stack group wide Grievous stacks, you will not have a good time. If using the [Soul of the Farseer](http://www.wowhead.com/item=151647/soul-of-the-farseer&bonus=3630) legendary, make sure you are using [Cloudburst Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=157153/cloudburst-totem) to help burst heal the group back to full. Don’t be afraid to use group wide healing cooldowns to mitigate Grievous stacks out of combat while you are working your way through topping off your group.


# Legendaries


Prydaz, Xavaric's Magnum Opus

25% more health against burst damage sources. Many bosses on high tyrannical keys will require you to use [Prydaz](http://www.wowhead.com/item=132444/prydaz-xavarics-magnum-opus&bonus=3630) to soak unavoidable damage.

Soul of the Farseer

This allows you to take both [Cloudburst Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=157153/cloudburst-totem) and [Echo of the Elements](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108283/echo-of-the-elements). Cloudburst has many uses in instances with regular periodic spikes of damage as well as affixes like [bursting](http://www.wowhead.com/affix=11/bursting) and [grievous](http://www.wowhead.com/affix=12/grievous) where your group will be taking damage constantly after combat.

Velen’s Future Sight

[Velens](http://www.wowhead.com/item=144258/velens-future-sight&bonus=3630) is an extra micro cooldown to increase your throughput. Typically this is not needed as you push the upper end of mythic+ since most mechanics will result in one-shot deaths if anyone gets hit by them.

Roots of Shaladrassil

[Roots](http://www.wowhead.com/item=132466/roots-of-shaladrassil&bonus=3630) can be very helpful against bosses like Dresaron (Darkheart Thicket) and Talixae Flamewreath (Court of Stars) on weeks with Grievous since you will have to focus less healing on yourself and heal your group members easier.

Sephuz’s Secret

Since we have [Wind Shear](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=57994/wind-shear) as well as [Lightning Surge Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=192058/lightning-surge-totem) you are almost always going to proc [Sephuz’s Secret](http://www.wowhead.com/item=132452/sephuzs-secret&bonus=3630) on a trash pull. This helps in DPSing as well as gives some extra throughput. If you are using any kind of invis pot skips make sure you are wearing this for the extra movement speed.

Kil’Jaeden’s Burning Wish

This has the exact same stats as [Velen’s Future Sight](http://www.wowhead.com/item=144258/velens-future-sight&bonus=3630) except provides a large AoE damage nuke which we are lacking since our only AoE spell is [Chain Lightning](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=421/chain-lightning).

Pristine Proto-Scale Girdle

The elemental belt in combination with [Echo of the Elements](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108283/echo-of-the-elements) can do some serious damage on single targets if you are able to maintain the debuff provided from this belt. Optimal rotation for this is to wait to [Lava Burst](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=51505/lava-burst) until there is 2.5 sec left on [the belt debuff](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=224852/pristine-proto-scale-girdle). Distance from the target also has an impact since the belt debuff is applied once the Lava Burst projectile hits the target.

Uncertain Reminder

On [tyrannical](http://www.wowhead.com/affix=9/tyrannical) bosses sometimes it is best to have extra [bloodlust](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=2825/bloodlust) uptime. Remember this also extends the duration of [Sense of Urgency](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=207355/sense-of-urgency) as well.


# Trinkets


The following is a list of trinkets that are useful in Mythic+ dungeons.  All of these trinkets can be used to great effectiveness in the right situations but can be completely useless in others.  Having a good mix of these trinkets will provide you with multiple combinations that excel in various situations.

Ishkar's Felshield Emitter

This enables you to provide a shield to yourself or your allies to live through a burst of damage. The damage provided by the explosion of this is also decent to use as a DPS trinket.

Archive of Faith

A decent alternative to [Ishkar’s](http://www.wowhead.com/item=151957) to provide an absorb shield to deal with burst mechanics.

The Deceiver's Grand Design

A decent replacement for [Ishkar’s](http://www.wowhead.com/item=151957). Slightly worse than [Archive of Faith](http://www.wowhead.com/item=147006) and [Ishkar’s](http://www.wowhead.com/item=151957) because the absorb will only proc when the target falls below 35%.  Thus a one shot will still kill the target with DGD on them.

Highfather's Machination

Just like in raiding, this trinket provides a big throughput of healing when people are consistently getting to low health. This is mostly a set and forget trinket during trash and can be useful during skittish weeks or against mobs that deal area of effect damage that is unavoidable.

Eonar's Compassion

The item level of this trinket makes it alright to use in M+ but not desirable due to the lack of utility it provides.

This is also true for [Aman’Thul’s Vision](http://www.wowhead.com/item=154172).

Oakheart's Gnarled Root

The strongest single target DPS trinket available for us as Resto Shamans. It is definitely worth trying to pick up from DPS members who will likely not want it after a DHT run.

Carafe of Searing Light

The second best single target DPS trinket available. The mana return isn’t too useful during dungeons but can help on [Tyrannical](http://www.wowhead.com/affix=9) bosses.

Deteriorated Construct Core

This trinket is our only real option for a ranged AoE trinket.  It’s not super great considering our only AoE is 3 target [Chain Lightning](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=421) or spreading [Flame Shock](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=188838)s.

Terminus Signaling Beacon

The on use effect of this trinket is great for burst AoE. Combo this with [AG](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108281) for insane healing at the same time.

Umbral Moonglaives

Much like the Terminus Signaling Beacon, this provides massive AoE damage on demand. Using this with [AG](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108281) provides good healing output as well.

Smoldering Titanguard

[Tyrannical](http://www.wowhead.com/affix=9) bosses at high enough levels will one shot you through all your DRs and health increases. This trinket directly counters those abilities when timed properly.  The damage provided is negligible since the whole purpose of this trinket is to survive one spell cast from a boss.


# Stats


Much like raiding ([Raiding Stats Article](http://ancestralguidance.com/stats-and-where-to-find-them/)), mastery is going to fall behind in high [mythic+](http://www.wowhead.com/item=138019/mythic-keystone) dungeons. This is because most mechanics will likely one shot people without heavy damage reductions. There is also a lot of downtime in dungeons where mastery will have no use. Therefore we feel that it is better to go for versatility, critical strike and haste as they will impact both healing and damage throughput. Versatility has the added benefit of providing damage reduction which is incredibly valuable some weeks. Critical Strike is always good since one of your primary healing sources will be [Healing Surge](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=8004/healing-surge) which can be easily crit capped with [Tidal Waves](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=51564/tidal-waves). Haste is also a very valuable stat since it will allow you to dump your mana quicker with little punishment since you are able to drink after each pack. If you are looking to push as much damage as possible, look into pieces with versatility and haste as they are our highest DPS stats.
