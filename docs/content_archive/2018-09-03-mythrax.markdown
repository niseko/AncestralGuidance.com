# PRIMARY MECHANICS


Mythrax is a two phase encounter that revolves around managing raid wide stacks of [Annihilation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272336/annihilation).  While most mechanics in this fight deal smaller amounts of damage compared to other encounters, they can be very lethal when paired with high stacks of [Annihilation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272336/annihilation).  When any player is struck by any of Mythrax's abilities in Phase 1, they will drop some [Existence Fragment](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272480/existence-fragment)s and gain stacks of [Annihilation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272336/annihilation).  You are able to reduce stacks of [Annihilation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272336/annihilation) by running through [Existence Fragment](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272480/existence-fragment)s.

In phase 1 of the encounter you will face Mythrax alone.  During this time, Mythrax has three abilities that affect healers, all of these abilities force your raid to be spread.
The first of which is [Obliteration Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273554/obliteration-blast).  Mythrax will aim [Obliteration Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273554/obliteration-blast) at a random raid member and shot a massive beam at them dealing damage to anyone caught in the blast and applying stacks of [Annihilation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272336/annihilation) as well.
Next is [Oblivion Sphere](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272407/oblivion-sphere) which effectively mind controls random raid members by placing a large shadow orb on them which causes them to remain mind controlled until they are moved out of the circle.  Any damage caused to players afflicted by [Oblivion Sphere](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272407/oblivion-sphere) will knock them away from the source of the damage.
Lastly, [Imminent Ruin](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272536/imminent-ruin) is a damage over time debuff that explodes at the end of the duration.  The damage of the explosion hits everyone in the raid, but is reduced the further the target with [Imminent Ruin](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272536/imminent-ruin) is from the other raid members.

Phase 2 happens when Mythrax hits 66% and 33% - this phase starts by Mythrax running to the center of the room and reducing all damage taken by 99%.  He then summons two N'raqi Destroyers and casts multiple [Oblivion Sphere](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272407/oblivion-sphere)s, shortly after the Spheres spawn, Mythrax will rotate between Spawning Visions of Madness and casting [Obliteration Beam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=274113/obliteration-beam).  Make sure you dodge[ Obliteration Beam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=274113/obliteration-beam), and have your group stack on one of the N'raqi Destroyers to counter the raid damage from [Annihilation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272336/annihilation) and the Visions of Madness.  When Mythrax leaves this phase to go back into phase one, any adds that are still alive will still need to be dealt with.

When Mythrax hits 20% health, he will cast [Essence Shatter](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=279013/essence-shatter).  This creates a tight enrage since [Annihilation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272336/annihilation) stacks will continue to grow at this point.


# TALENTS


![](http://ancestralguidance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mythraxHtalent.png)

Due to the semi-spread nature of the fight, [Wellspring](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=197995/wellspring) is recommended over [High Tide](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=157154/high-tide), and [Flash Flood](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=280614/flash-flood) over [Downpour](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=207778/downpour).  If you are lacking in healing during the phase 2's of the encounter, consider swapping to [Downpour](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=207778/downpour) for more burst AoE healing.  [Ancestral Vigor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=207401/ancestral-vigor) is almost 100% mandatory due to the maximum health reduction aspect of [Annihilation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272336/annihilation).


# HEALING TIPS





 	
  1. Line up casts of [Wellspring](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=197995/wellspring) with the explosion of [Imminent Ruin](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=272536/imminent-ruin).

 	
  2. Try to stay positioned near the middle of the room to be able to heal ranged behind you, and melee infront of you.

 	
  3. In the intermission phases, make sure you cast [Healing Rain](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73920/healing-rain) on as many people as possible in between Mythrax's casts of [Obliteration Beam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=274113/obliteration-beam).
