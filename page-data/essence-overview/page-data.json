These can be changed like Talents, and are meant to be changed with the content you are doing to make the most use out of them. With 8.2 right around the corner I thought I’d try to do a quick write-up of what we thought about the new Essences while testing them. </p>\n<p>I’ll give a quick description of what each Essence does, give some Pros and Cons for each, where and how easy they are to obtain, and try to explain situations where each of them would be useful. Keep in mind, this is from the PTR and things could still change (there were changes as recent as the day before writing this) and I’d imagine numbers tuning may not be final until the start of Mythic. Also, at the bottom I’ll try to list which Major/Minor powers from each Essence will be useful for us in most scenarios.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is NOT a BIS list.

When you activate Healing Tide Totem, immediately heal for 5% of maximum health.\n> \n> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>Pro:</strong> On some fights where there always needs to be healing (Jaina P3, Uu’nat P3, etc) the Major could be nice as it is our Major CD being activated, which means free healing. The minor power could be quite nice to have, especially if you can fit in an extra HTT during a fight.</p>\n<p><strong>Con:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108280/healing-tide-totem\">Healing Tide</a> is arguably one of the worst Healing CD’s unless it does very little to no overhealing, and because this is RNG as to when it activates, the Major power is probably too much RNG to be useful on progression (Similar to the Legendary Chest in Legion, just even worse). </p>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> Operation: Mechagon (new dungeon) </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rank 1: Kill King Mechagon</li>\n<li>Rank 2: Loot the pattern from King Mechagon and learn/use it</li>\n<li>Rank 3: Requires 4 Progression Sprockets from King Mechagon</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"vitality-conduit\"><a href=\"#vitality-conduit\" aria-label=\"vitality conduit permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><strong><a href=\"https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=299954/vitality-conduit\">Vitality Conduit</a></strong></h3>\n<blockquote>**Major:** (45 second CD) Direct the Vitality Conduit toward an ally. Every 0.5 seconds for 6 seconds, they transfer 9,482 health from the highest-health ally within 30 yards. If the target reaches full health, it jumps to the lowest-health nearby target for the remaining duration.\n> \n> **Minor:** (12 ppm + Haste) Targets of your heals have a very high chance to transfer 9,482 health from the highest-health ally within 30 yards. Health transfers leave 3,951 damage absorb shield on the target for 5 seconds.\n> \n> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>Pro:</strong> This will do a decent amount of healing to a target, on a relatively short CD. This could be decent in M+, especially with how much we can struggle to keep tanks up on some weeks. The Minor power could be nice, it was hard to test this on the PTR because you can only test Essences in the Proving Grounds (solo).</p>\n<p><strong>Con:</strong> This is a life-steal, and especially during progression that is something to always be wary of. It does steal from the highest health player, which is nice, but probably won’t be good enough as a major to be worth using. </p>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> Raiding </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rank 1: Cost 9 Aqueous Reliquary, from Radiance of Azshara, Queen’s Court, and Queen Azshara</li>\n<li>Rank 2: Cost 18 Aqueous Reliquary, from Radiance of Azshara, Queen’s Court, and Queen Azshara</li>\n<li>Rank 3: Cost 27 Aqueous Reliquary, from Radiance of Azshara, Queen’s Court, and Queen Azshara</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note</em>: The major is not a channel that you have to hold, but rather behaves like a buff.</p>\n<h3 id=\"worldvein-boon\"><a href=\"#worldvein-boon\" aria-label=\"worldvein boon permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=299334/worldvein-resonance\"><strong>Worldvein Boon</strong></a></h3>\n<blockquote>**Major:** (1 minute CD) Concentrate energy into the Heart of Azeroth, immediately causing 3 Lifeblood Shards (Grants you and any other ally using this Essence 154 primary stat while within 12 yards of the Lifeblood Shard.

I can definitely see groups having Worldvein stack areas, similar to Sliver stack groups like we saw in BoD and CoS.</p>\n<p><strong>Con:</strong> This was recently changed to allow you to only benefit from up to 4 Shards, making the Major not very good, assuming you can still gain a benefit from other people’s Minor Shards.
