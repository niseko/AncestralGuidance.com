# Mythic Mechanics


Mythic Fetid has multiple changes that alter how you handle the fight in general.  From a healer perspective, there is only one new mechanic to worry about which is the splashing of [Putrid Paroxysm](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262314/putrid-paroxysm) and [Malodorous Miasma](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262313/malodorous-miasma) which applies a stack of either [Malodorous Miasma](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262313/malodorous-miasma) or [Putrid Paroxysm](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262314/putrid-paroxysm) ([MM](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262313/malodorous-miasma) if no debuff present, or if [MM](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262313/malodorous-miasma) is present, and [PP](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262314/putrid-paroxysm) only if [PP](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262314/putrid-paroxysm) is present on the splash recipient).  [Malodorous Miasma](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262313/malodorous-miasma) has a small splash range while [Putrid Paroxysm](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262314/putrid-paroxysm) has a very large splash range.  Counter this by having your raid spread out around the room equally spaced with direct travel paths for tanks to avoid getting hit by anyone's debuffs.


# Suggested Talents


![](http://ancestralguidance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MFetid.png)

Due to the spread nature of the encounter, you will want to take full single target talents for Mythic Fetid Devourer.  You can consider taking [APT](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=207399/ancestral-protection-totem) to potentially save someone stuck in a [Rotting Regurgitation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262291/rotting-regurgitation).  If you find yourself not needing a lot of tank healing, look to take [Echo](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108283/echo-of-the-elements) over [ES](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=974/earth-shield).


# Notable Azerite Traits


Static stat Azerite traits are the best here such as [Archive of the Titans](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=280555/archive-of-the-titans), [Swirling Sands](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=280429/swirling-sands), or [Blightborne Infusion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=273823/blightborne-infusion).  [Swelling stream](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275488/swelling-stream) isn't a bad option, but it has reduced effectiveness due to the likelihood of some bounces of the Lesser Chain Heal being wasted.


# Mythic Healing Tips





 	
  * Shamans are very bad on this fight, remove [Chain Heal](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1064/chain-heal) and [Healing Rain](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73920/healing-rain) from your bars for this encounter to reduce accidental presses.

 	
  * Spot heal as best as possible, and use [Earth Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=974/earth-shield) on the tank that is tanking melee swings to get the most healing out of [Earth Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=974/earth-shield).

 	
  * I'm sorry if you don't have another healer to play for this encounter.
