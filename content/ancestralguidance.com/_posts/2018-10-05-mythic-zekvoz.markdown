# Mythic Mechanics


On mythic difficulty, Zek'voz does not again any additional mechanics.  Instead, several mechanics have several additions as well as both the projections of Yogg-Saron and C'thun being active the entire fight.  In addition, the last titan disc activates at 40% instead of 30%.  The first change to Zek'voz's abilities is the addition of another [Surging Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265451/surging-darkness) tick.  The first safe spot of every [Surging Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265451/surging-darkness) is the middle ring, which is then followed up by either inner or outer, then middle, then inner or outer again.  In addition, when Zek'voz summons small adds, both Silithid Warriors and Nerubian Voidweavers spawn at the same time.  The projections of Yogg-Saron and C'thun take turns between casting [Roiling Deceit](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265360/roiling-deceit) and [Eye Beam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=264382/eye-beam).  The first mechanic will always be [Roiling Deceit](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265360/roiling-deceit), then [Eye Beam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=264382/eye-beam).  Depending on when you push into the sub 40% phase you can skip one of these mechanics and get back to back of the other mechanic.  Upon pushing into the sub 40% phase, Silithid Warriors and Nerubian Voidweavers stop spawning, but the projections of Yogg-Saron and C'thun continue to cast [Roiling Deceit](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265360/roiling-deceit) and [Eye Beam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=264382/eye-beam).  Lastly, [Eye Beam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=264382/eye-beam)'s cast time is reduced to 1.5 seconds.  Always pre-spread for [Eye Beam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=264382/eye-beam) to avoid chaining hits.


# Suggested Talents


![](http://ancestralguidance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MZek.png)

Standard raiding talents are suggested for Zek'voz.  [Graceful Spirit](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192088/graceful-spirit) is great due to the amount of movement required on [Surging Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265451/surging-darkness) casts.  [Wellspring](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=197995/wellspring), [Downpour ](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=207778/downpour)and [EWT](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=198838/earthen-wall-totem) are all great for dealing with the consecutive bursts of damage on this fight.  You can consider taking [CBT](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=157153/cloudburst-totem) if you feel that downpour isn't being use effectively.


# Notable Azerite Traits


[Swelling Stream](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=275488/swelling-stream) is a good pick to be used to counter [Surging Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265451/surging-darkness) hits.  Stacking multiples of [Overflowing Shores](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=278095/overflowing-shores) can also enable [Healing Rain](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73920/healing-rain) to be used to counter [Surging Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265451/surging-darkness) ticks.  [Sprouting Spirits](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=279504/spouting-spirits) can be helpful if used as a minor cooldown when your raid is stacked.


# Mythic Healing Tips





 	
  * Use [Healing Rain](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73920/healing-rain) and [EWT](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=198838/earthen-wall-totem) in the middle ring of [Surging Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265451/surging-darkness) since it is guaranteed to be twice out of the four hits of every [Surging Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265451/surging-darkness).

 	
  * Use [Downpour ](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=207778/downpour)and [Wellspring](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=197995/wellspring) while your raid is stacked during [Surging Darkness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=265451/surging-darkness).

 	
  * The frequency of [Titan Spark](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=264954/titan-spark) does not increase too much in the final phase.  Pace accordingly by saving a tiny bit more mana for the final burn (mostly 1% mana to 1% boss hp).

 	
  * If your raid needs more bodies to soak [Orb of Corruption](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267334/orb-of-corruption), try to soak one of the first two and use [Reincarnation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=20608/reincarnation) to gain some extra time on the boss.
