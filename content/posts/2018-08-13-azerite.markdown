[Overflowing Shores](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=278095/overflowing-shores) - Improves the radius of [Healing Rain](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73920) by 10% as well as causes an initial burst of healing on up to 6 allies inside [Healing Rain](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73920) upon cast completion.  Only the healing scales with multiple traits.

[Soothing Waters](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=272989/soothing-waters) - Increases the healing of the initial heal of [Chain Heal](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1064).  This does not effect the bounces of [Chain Heal](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1064) at all.  Stacking multiple traits adds more healing.

[Surging Tides](http://bfa.wowhead.com/spell=279181/surging-tides) - Adds an absorb shield when casting [Riptide](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=61295) on targets below 50% health.  This trait only applies to the initial heal of [Riptide](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=61295).  Stacking multiples of this trait increases the size of the absorb shield.

# Traits to Obtain

		
						All traits are evaluated on their own.  Any Uldir traits are evaluated without Reorigination Array included.  This ranking is geared towards PvE with a focus on raiding.  Traits for M+ are the same as raiding if you are focused on healing, but consider going for DPS traits if you are comfortable in pushing high keys and need more DPS.					
			
		
		

Below is a table generated as a generalized ranking of traits in terms of intellect.  To compare Azerite pieces, add up the intellect value for each trait at the respective item level as well as the intellect on the pieces.  Whichever has the higher value is the better piece generally.  If you want to use your own logs to generate a table just like this one tailored to how you play, check out our guide on how to use our Azerite and trinket spreadsheet linked below.

		
					
			[
						Spreadsheet Guide
					](https://ancestralguidance.com/spreadsheet/)
		

When evaluating different pieces of Azerite Armor, consider the outer row as the main power of the piece.  The middle and inner rings generally provide very small increases to your overall throughput on most encounters.  Don't be afraid to drop a middle or inner trait for a higher level Azerite piece as the all traits scale off item level.  Your first Archive of the Titans or Laser Matrix (to activate Reorigination Array) is the only mandatory trait when raiding.  Best of luck hunting optimized pieces!
