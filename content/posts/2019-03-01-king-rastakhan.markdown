# Fight Mechanics


King Rastakhan is a four phase encounter that starts out with three adds that must be killed to actually fight Rastakhan.  Siegebreaker Roka casts [Meteor Leap](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=284688/meteor-leap), make sure you soak this as a raid.  Prelate Za'lan casts [Seal of Purification](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=290448/seal-of-purification) at a DPS member, make sure you don't stand in this.  Headhunter Gal'wana casts [Grevious Axe](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=284781/grievous-axe) at 3 random players on Mythic.  These targets need to be topped as quickly as possible.  During this, Rastakhan will cast [Plague of Toads](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=284933/plague-of-toads), [Greater Serpent Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=285172/greater-serpent-totem), and [Scorching Detonation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=284831/scorching-detonation).  The toads and serpent totems should be avoided at all costs, and the [Scorching Detonation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=284831/scorching-detonation) you will want to use a healing cooldown for.

Once Phase 2 begins you will want to position yourself on the edge of Bwonsomdi's [Aura of Death](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=285190/aura-of-death#used-by-npc) to heal the tank who is currently tanking Bwonsomdi.  Spread out for [Plague of Fire](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=285349/plague-of-fire).  Dodge [Plague of Toads](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=284933/plague-of-toads).  If you are the only shaman in your raid, use [Tremor Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=8143/tremor-totem) on the first [Zombie Dust Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=285003/zombie-dust-totem), and then skip the next, using it again on the third totem.  [Death's Door](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=288449/deaths-door) need to be placed where ever your raid leader decides.  You can place them near the door to make the next Bwonsomdi phase easier by creating a barrier, or you can place one near the middle of the room to allow melee going down to remove their [Deathly Withering](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=285195/deathly-withering) if you are going for the non-cheese strategy.  Once your barrier of [Death's Door](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=288449/deaths-door)s or your single drop off point is created, drop all [Death's Door](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=288449/deaths-door)s on a wall or in a corner for the rest of the fight.

When King Rastakhan reaches 60% health remaining, Bwonsomdi will pull half the raid (closest raid members to him) into the death realm.  In the death realm you will always gain stacks of [Deathly Withering](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=285195/deathly-withering) and will have to dodge [Dread Reaping](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=287147/dread-reaping).  If you chose to do the cheese barrier strategy, simply stand behind the barrier and heal people after their [Caress of Death](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=285213/caress-of-death) wears off.  Run away from Bwonsomdi when he casts [Inevitable End](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=287333/inevitable-end).  If you are not chosen, simply heal the remaining raid members from damage done by [Scorching Detonation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=284831/scorching-detonation) and [Withering Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=288053/withering-burst), and soak the missiles spawned by [Seal of Bwonsomdi](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=286671/seal-of-bwonsamdi).

Once Bwonsomdi reaches 50% health remaining, the death realm group is sent back up to the realm of the living.  From here King Rastakhan gains the ability [Inevitable End](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=287333/inevitable-end) and retains all his phase 2 abilities except for [Zombie Dust Totem](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=285003/zombie-dust-totem).  Simply dodge the [Dread Reaping](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=287147/dread-reaping) coming from the [Death's Door](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=288449/deaths-door)s around the room and handle the rest of the mechanics like you did in the previous phases.


# Suggested Talents


![](http://ancestralguidance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Champion.png)

In the scenario you are not sent down to the death realm, swap [EWT](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=198838/earthen-wall-totem) over to [AV](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=207401/ancestral-vigor).  If your group decides to do the cheese barrier [Death's Door](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=288449/deaths-door) strategy, consider swapping Graceful Spirit over to [WRT](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=192077/wind-rush-totem) if you are the healer going down to the death realm to prevent people from mass triggering [Withering Burst](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=288053/withering-burst) when Bwonsomdi casts [Inevitable End](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=287333/inevitable-end).


# Notable Azerite Traits


There are no azerite traits are necessary for King Rstakhan.  If you are doing the cheese [Death's Door](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=288449/deaths-door) barrier straegy, then [Spouting Spirits](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=279504/spouting-spirits) can be quite strong since you will be stacked up with 9 other people in the death realm.


# Healing Tips





 	
  * If you are solo healing the Death Realm, save both [HTT](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=127945/healing-tide-totem) and [SLT](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=98008/spirit-link-totem) to do so.  Also try to go down with around 80% mana.

 	
  * Never heal someone with [Caress of Death](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=285213/caress-of-death).  Make some sort of notification on your raid frames to ensure you don't waste mana and casts.
