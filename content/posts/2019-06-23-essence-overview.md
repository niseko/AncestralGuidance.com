# Restoration Shaman and Essences for the Heart of Azeroth

Essences are a new system coming in 8.2 that allow you to use 1 Major/Minor Essence, and 2 additional Minor Essences. These can be changed like Talents, and are meant to be changed with the content you are doing to make the most use out of them. With 8.2 right around the corner I thought I’d try to do a quick write-up of what we thought about the new Essences while testing them. 

I’ll give a quick description of what each Essence does, give some Pros and Cons for each, where and how easy they are to obtain, and try to explain situations where each of them would be useful. Keep in mind, this is from the PTR and things could still change (there were changes as recent as the day before writing this) and I’d imagine numbers tuning may not be final until the start of Mythic. Also, at the bottom I’ll try to list which Major/Minor powers from each Essence will be useful for us in most scenarios.

>This is NOT a BIS list.  Consider the pros and cons of each essence to determine which to use for now.


### [Artifice of Time](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=299506/artifice-of-time)

<div class="filename">Major</div>

```
(3 minute CD) Creates a time vortex around a player absorbing 331,288 damage and healing 6 seconds. When this expires, the absorbed damage and healing is delivered over 10 seconds and the damage is reduced by 20%.
```

<div class="filename">Minor</div>

```
Your heals have a very high chance to grant the target 281 Haste and 281 Speed for 8 seconds.
```

**Pro:** This is very similar to the [Void Stone](https://www.wowhead.com/item=167865/void-stone) trinket we have from Crucible of Storms, but absorbing more damage/healing. This will probably be a nice pick in some M+ dungeons or in some niche situations in raid when you need to save a person that will be taking a lot of damage in a short period of time. 


**Con:** It’s unlikely that you’ll be able to use the entire shield, so in terms of healing this probably isn’t the essence of choice unless you need to take it.

**Location:** PvP and Honor Achievements

  * Rank 1: Win a PvP Island, an Epic BG, and a normal BG
  * Rank 2: Gain 15,000 honor from PvP
  * Rank 3: Gain 50,000 honor from PvP

_Note:_ Unlike [Void Stone](https://www.wowhead.com/item=167865/void-stone), you do want to heal into this.  This isn't a shared healing / damage absorb, it is a delay of damage / healing.  If you do not heal into this, whoever you use it on may die from the damage caused when [Standstill](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=296094/standstill) expires.

### [Conflict of Strife](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=303868/conflict-and-strife)

<div class="filename">Major</div>

```
Gives us the PvP talent [Ancestral Gift](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=290254/ancestral-gift) (Cannot be silenced for 5 seconds after activating Spiritwalker’s Grace) and while you are stunned the defensive benefit from Strife (minor power) is doubled. Dispelling, interrupting, or applying cc also grants a stack of Strife.
```

<div class="filename">Minor</div>

```
(10 ppm, 3sec ICD) Your spells and abilities have a chance to increase your Versatility for 14 seconds, stacking up to 8 times. Getting cc’d also gains a stack of Strife.
```

**Pro:** I can’t think of anything honestly, I’d rather just get silenced and not use up an essence spot. The Minor is decent, and may be good enough to fill up a minor slot, but there are also some other decent minors. It has a high ppm, which means you should (in theory) be able to reliably maintain high-ish stacks of the Versatility buff.

**Con:** It doesn't contribute to throughput in any way.  Most encounters either have predictable interrupts or don't have any.

**Location:** PvP and Weekly War Chest

  * Rank 1: Open a PvP War Chest
  * Rank 2: Reach 1000 PvP Rating and open a PvP War Chest
  * Rank 3: Combine items gathered from the weekly PvP War Chest

### [Life-Binder’s Invocation](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=293032/life-binders-invocation)

<div class="filename">Major</div>

```
(2.5 minute CD) Implant 40 [Seeds of Eonar](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=296211/seed-of-eonar) (Heals for 199 every 0.9 seconds, if the target takes damage the Seed bursts, healing them for 4132) divided over all allies within 30 yards. Seeds that expire unused reduce the cooldown of this ability by 2 seconds.
```

<div class="filename">Minor</div>

```
(15 ppm) Your heals have a very high chance to implant a [Seed of Eonar](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=296211/seed-of-eonar) in the target for 15 seconds.
```

**Pro:** This is a fairly weak 2.5 minute CD that can be used just to give your raid extra raid CD’s to use during high damage parts of fights. The HoT portion of the Seeds are quite low so the power of this essence comes with raidwide aoe damage so that the seeds burst, doing more healing.

**Con:** The HoT of the Seeds are quite weak so this Essence probably isn’t super powerful unless your group needs the extra CD’s or you can make use of the seeds bursting.

**Location:** Mythic+ dungeons and Weekly Cache

  * Rank 1: Complete a +4 dungeon in Season 3
  * Rank 2: Complete a +7 dungeon in Season 3
  * Rank 3: Combine 15 items gathered from the weekly Mythic+ Cache

### [Memory of Lucid Dreams](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=299372/memory-of-lucid-dreams)

<div class="filename">Major</div>

```
(3 minute CD) Use the Heart of Azeroth, increasing your Mana generation rate by 100% and your Leech by 623 for 12 seconds.
```

<div class="filename">Minor</div>

```
(2.4 ppm + Haste) Your spells and abilities have a chance to refund 50% of the Mana spent on them, healing you for 11,956 and increasing your Versatility by 502 for 8 seconds.
```

**Pro:** The on-use gives 800 mana every second and with that and the use of the minor can restore quite a large amount of mana over the course of a fight. 

**Con:** This Essence only becomes really good if you’re going to make use of the extra mana you are getting. If you use this but end the fight at 50% mana then you could have easily taken another Essence that does healing and been more beneficial to the group. 

**Location:** New Follower system in Nazjatar

  * Rank 1: Get one follower to level 3
  * Rank 2: Get 3000 xp combined between all the followers
  * Rank 3: Get 6000 xp combined between all the followers

### [Ripple in Space](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=302982/ripple-in-space)

<div class="filename">Major</div>

```
(1 minute CD) Creates an Azerite beacon at a target location and after 2 seconds you will relocate to that beacon and deal 13,758 Fire damage to all nearby enemies. For 10 seconds after teleporting you take 10% reduced damage.
```

<div class="filename">Minor</div>

```
Your movement speed is increased by 5% and when you move more than 25 yards within 4 seconds, you gain 540 Intellect for 20 seconds (can only occur every 30 seconds)
```

**Pro:** This can be _very useful_ if you need to dodge boss abilities. As an example, you could use this just before the Mekkatorque ability that knocks you in the air, and will be able to dodge the mechanic without being a Goblin. This works similar to [Blink](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=1953/blink), so you may be able to even teleport through things like Uu’nat beams.

**Con:** This obviously does no healing, and for the most part the damage portion of this essence is negligible. The minor is okay, but this Essence will probably only be used to give us extra movement on a relatively short CD if we need it.

**Location:** Warmode (World PvP)

  * Rank 1: Kill 25 players of the opposite faction in Nazjatar
  * Rank 2: Achievement: Fighting on Two Fronts (warmode activities)
  * Rank 3: Complete the Call to Arms Weekly quests

### [The Crucible of Flame](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=299353/concentrated-flame)

<div class="filename">Major</div>

```
(30 second recharge) Blasts the target with a ball of concentrated flame, dealing 10,329 Fire damage to an enemy of healing an ally for 10,329, then burn the target for an additional 75% of the damage or healing over 6 seconds. Each cast of Concentrated Flame deals 100% increased damage or healing. This bonus resets after every third cast. (2 charges)
```

<div class="filename">Minor</div>

```
(3 ppm + haste) Your spells and abilities have a chance to cauterize your target for 7150 Fire damage over 10 seconds or healing an ally for 7150 over 10 seconds, stacking up to 3 times.
```

**Pro:** It has a short CD and the initial healing of it feeds [CBT](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=157153/cloudburst-totem). The minor also is okay, however there are better ones out there.

**Con:** It just doesn’t seem to do enough healing to be worth using up your Major slot for so if this is used it will likely be used as a minor power. 

**Location:** Artifact Power

  * Rank 1: New intro quest with Magni
  * Rank 2: Reach AP level 54
  * Rank 3: Reach AP level 58

### [The Ever-Rising Tide](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=299875/overcharge-mana)

<div class="filename">Major</div>

```
(30 second CD) Overcharge your mana for 8 seconds, causing each spell you cast to increase your healing by 4%, stacking. While overcharged, your mana regeneration is halted, and you gain 10% haste.
```

<div class="filename">Minor</div>

```
(1.75 ppm) Your heals have a chance to grant either 1,306 Intellect for 10 seconds or 2,520 mana. Chance of receiving mana increases with your missing mana. 20% chance to gain both effects.
```

**Pro:** The cooldown of this essence fits perfectly with [CBT](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=157153/cloudburst-totem), and although our cast times are longer than many of the other healers, we are able to reach a decent amount of stacks by mainly using instant casts, totems and [tw](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=51564/tidal-waves) buffed [Healing Wave](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=77472/healing-wave)s. It is also worth noting that you can precast heals into the on-use effect to start with 2 stacks instead of just 1. [CBT](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=157153/cloudburst-totem) should be used in the later half while you're building stacks to reach maximum efficiency on it. You are able to use cheap Totems like [earthbind](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=2484/earthbind-totem) and [tremor](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=8143/tremor-totem) to build stacks but usually you'll have to be healing either way.

**Con:** Your mana regen is halted during the 8sec windows, so this will probably be the most mana-intensive Essence there is, but if used correctly could create a very fun playstyle.

**Location:** Nazjatar Reputation 

  * Rank 1: Ankoan/Unshackled - Honored, cost 10 Prismatic Manapearl
  * Rank 2: Ankoan/Unshackled - Revered, cost 25 Prismatic Manapearl
  * Rank 3: Ankoan/Unshackled - Exalted, cost 50 Prismatic Manapearl

_Note: _The healing % stacks only proc off spells that cost mana. The maximum duration of the healing increase is 16 seconds.

### [The Well of Existence](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=299936/the-well-of-existence)

<div class="filename">Major</div>

```
(15 second CD) Release all healing stored in the Well of Existence into an ally. This healing is amplified by 50%. The Well will not release more healing than needed to fully heal the target.
```

<div class="filename">Minor</div>

```
15% of your overhealing is stored in the Well of Existence. When you heal a target under 50% health, the Well releases up to 5,184 of its stored healing into them. When the Well contains less than 13,252 healing, it absorbs healing twice as quickly.
```

**Pro:** The Major does do very little, if any overhealing to targets, meaning this is quite literally free healing you can put out on players. The Minor power was known to be doing really well in the PTR raid testings.

**Con:** This only stores Overhealing, which isn’t something that you want to _try_ to do and is generally bad as it’s just wasted mana. I don’t believe the Major is strong enough to warrant using over some of the other Essences.

**Location:** Mechagon Reputation 

  * Rank 1: Rustbolt - Honored, cost S.P.A.R.E. Crates and Galvanic Oscillators
  * Rank 2: Rustbolt - Revered, cost S.P.A.R.E. Crates and Galvanic Oscillators
  * Rank 3: Rustbolt - Exalted, cost S.P.A.R.E. Crates and Galvanic Oscillators

### [Vision of Perfection](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=297869/vision-of-perfection)

<div class="filename">Major</div>

```
Your spells and abilities have a chance to activate Healing Tide Totem for 35% of its base duration. When the Vision of Perfection activates, you and up to 2 other nearby allies gain 107 Haste for 10 seconds.
```

<div class="filename">Minor</div>

```
Reduces the cooldown of Healing Tide Totem by 13% and increases your Versatility by 45. When you activate Healing Tide Totem, immediately heal for 5% of maximum health.
```

**Pro:** On some fights where there always needs to be healing (Jaina P3, Uu’nat P3, etc) the Major could be nice as it is our Major CD being activated, which means free healing. The minor power could be quite nice to have, especially if you can fit in an extra HTT during a fight.

**Con:** [Healing Tide](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108280/healing-tide-totem) is arguably one of the worst Healing CD’s unless it does very little to no overhealing, and because this is RNG as to when it activates, the Major power is probably too much RNG to be useful on progression (Similar to the Legendary Chest in Legion, just even worse). 

**Location:** Operation: Mechagon (new dungeon) 

  * Rank 1: Kill King Mechagon
  * Rank 2: Loot the pattern from King Mechagon and learn/use it
  * Rank 3: Requires 4 Progression Sprockets from King Mechagon

### [Vitality Conduit](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=299954/vitality-conduit)

<div class="filename">Major</div>

```
(45 second CD) Direct the Vitality Conduit toward an ally. Every 0.5 seconds for 6 seconds, they transfer 9,482 health from the highest-health ally within 30 yards. If the target reaches full health, it jumps to the lowest-health nearby target for the remaining duration.
```

<div class="filename">Minor</div>

```
(12 ppm + Haste) Targets of your heals have a very high chance to transfer 9,482 health from the highest-health ally within 30 yards. Health transfers leave 3,951 damage absorb shield on the target for 5 seconds.
```

**Pro:** This will do a decent amount of healing to a target, on a relatively short CD. This could be decent in M+, especially with how much we can struggle to keep tanks up on some weeks. The Minor power could be nice, it was hard to test this on the PTR because you can only test Essences in the Proving Grounds (solo).

**Con:** This is a life-steal, and especially during progression that is something to always be wary of. It does steal from the highest health player, which is nice, but probably won’t be good enough as a major to be worth using. 

**Location:** Raiding 

  * Rank 1: Cost 9 Aqueous Reliquary, from Radiance of Azshara, Queen’s Court, and Queen Azshara
  * Rank 2: Cost 18 Aqueous Reliquary, from Radiance of Azshara, Queen’s Court, and Queen Azshara
  * Rank 3: Cost 27 Aqueous Reliquary, from Radiance of Azshara, Queen’s Court, and Queen Azshara

_Note_: The major is not a channel that you have to hold, but rather behaves like a buff.

### [Worldvein Resonance](https://ptr.wowhead.com/spell=299334/worldvein-resonance)

<div class="filename">Major</div>

```
(1 minute CD) Concentrate energy into the Heart of Azeroth, immediately causing 3 Lifeblood Shards (Grants you and any other ally using this Essence 154 primary stat while within 12 yards of the Lifeblood Shard. You can benefit from a maximum of 4 Lifeblood Shards at a time) to erupt from the nearby ground for 18 seconds.
```

<div class="filename">Minor</div>

```
(13sec avg spawn) Every 1-25 seconds, a Lifeblood Shard erupts from the nearby ground for 18 seconds.
```

**Pro:** Gaining primary stat is never a bad thing, but the ‘best’ use for this is probably the Minor Essence because you can now only gain a benefit from up to 4 Shards at a time. I can definitely see groups having Worldvein stack areas, similar to Sliver stack groups like we saw in BoD and CoS.

**Con:** This was recently changed to allow you to only benefit from up to 4 Shards, making the Major not very good, assuming you can still gain a benefit from other people’s Minor Shards. Also, if you have to move away from a certain area, you will not gain the benefit of this Essence until more shards spawn.

**Location:** Island Expeditions

  * Rank 1: Complete your weekly Island Expedition quest (map)
  * Rank 2: Collect 15 Fragments of Zem’lan’s Lost Treasure Map from Islands + complete the mission that follows
  * Rank 3: Recruit a Captain follower, and complete the mission that follows

### Essences to Obtain (TLDR)

You’ll eventually want to unlock all of the Essences and all of their Ranks, as they can be useful in many different types of content and will most likely be with us for the rest of the expansion. Because they’re just now coming out, if you have limited time you should try to aim for _at least_ these Essences, as they’re (probably) the best ones to have early on. 

  * **Life-Binder’s Invocation**
  * **Memory of Lucid Dreams**
  * **The Ever-Rising Tide**
  * **Vision of Perfection**
  * **The Well of Existence**
