An incredibly common ideology among healers, especially shaman, is that their damage does not matter. While it is true that as resto shaman, we have lower damage than other healers, you should always try to maximize your damage in a progression environment. The smallest amounts of damage can make all of the difference when trying to down a boss for the first time. Whether it is pushing for earlier phase transition or attempting to beat a hard enrage, every small amount of damage can help.

		
			

# When Should I DPS?

		
		

As a healer, you need to be able to identify when throwing casts into damage abilities will be the most efficient use of your time. This can be dependent on groups, content level and encounter. On most fights, you are generally safe to DPS on the pull. It is good to also identify periods of a boss fight where all required healing can easily be covered by incidental healing. Times like this are great to deal some additional damage, as your alternative is to spam [Healing Wave](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=77472/healing-wave) on targets that do not need the healing. 

		
			

# DPS Priority

		
		

If mana is of no consequence, then your **single target** rotation will look like this:

<blockquote>  1. Keep [Flame Shock](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=188838/flame-shock) up (Refresh when <7 seconds)
>   2. Use [Lava Burst](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=51505/lava-burst) on Cooldown
>   3. Use [Lightning Bolt](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=403/lightning-bolt) as a filler
> </blockquote>

If mana is of no consequence, then your **2 target** rotation will look like this:

<blockquote>  1. Keep [Flame Shock](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=188838/flame-shock) up on both targets (Refresh when <7 seconds)
>   2. Use [Lava Burst](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=51505/lava-burst) on Cooldown
>   3. Use [Chain Lightning](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=421/chain-lightning) as a filler
> </blockquote>

If mana is of no consequence, then your **3+ target** rotation will look like this:

<blockquote>  1. Keep [Flame Shock](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=188838/flame-shock) up on up to 3 priority targets, no more or else you are letting it fall off (Refresh when <7 seconds)
>   2. Use any [Lava Surge](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=77756/lava-surge) procs
>   3. Use [Chain Lightning](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=421/chain-lightning) as a filler
> </blockquote>

If you find yourself struggling at all with mana, simply use [Lightning Bolt](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=403/lightning-bolt).

		
			

# Talents

		
		

The only Talent that augments our DPS is [Echo of the Elements](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108283/echo-of-the-elements). This talent gives access to 2 charges of [Lava Burst](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=51505/lava-burst). This helps you avoid wasting casts of [Lava Burst](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=51505/lava-burst) due to [Lava Surge](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=77756/lava-surge) procs.

		
			

# Tips

		
		

  * Don’t bother using [Flame Shock](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=188838/flame-shock) on a mob that won’t live very long
    * Unless this add dying is a priority, then bank 2 [Lava Burst](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=51505/lava-burst) charges to burst it
  * You can [Flame Shock](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=188838/flame-shock) the boss during periods of movement to fill in gaps
  * Always try to use [Lava Surge](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=77756/lava-surge) procs on a priority target (adds like modules on Mythic Argus)
		
			

# Stats

		
		

  * **Intellect**
    * All of our DPS spells’ damage scale directly with Intellect.
  * **Critical Strike**
    * Increases the chance for your spells to deal double damage. Due to the guaranteed crit on [Lava Burst](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=51505/lava-burst) when [Flame Shock](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=188838/flame-shock) is up, this stat has reduced value on single target. It increases in value in AoE situations when [Chain Lightning](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=421/chain-lightning) is more prevalent.
  * **Haste**
    * Reduces the cast time of the damage spells as well adds additional ticks to [Flame Shock](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=188838/flame-shock).
  * **Versatility**
    * A direct increase in the form of a flat boost to any of our damage spells.
  * **Mastery**
    * Only affects our healing, and as a result, is absolutely worthless when it comes to damage.
