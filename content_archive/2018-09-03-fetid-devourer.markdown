# PRIMARY MECHANICS


Fetid Devourer is a very straight forward Patchwerk like fight.

The main mechanics on the fight are dealing with the massive amount of damage tanks are taking, as well as healing players targeted by [Malodorous Miasma](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262313/malodorous-miasma) which turns into [Putrid Paroxysm](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262314/putrid-paroxysm).  Throughout the fight Fetid Devourer will cast [Shockwave Stomp](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262288/shockwave-stomp), knocking back all players and dealing damage to your entire raid, try to position yourself so you get knocked into a wall so you have less downtime on healing priority targets.  When Fetid Devourer's energy reaches 100, it will cast [Rotting Regurgitation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262291/rotting-regurgitation) which is a large endless cone that deals large amounts of damage and will apply a stack of [Malodorous Miasma](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262313/malodorous-miasma) to anyone hit by it.  Avoid getting hit by [Rotting Regurgitation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262291/rotting-regurgitation) at all costs, but if you are going to be hit by it, use [Astral Shift](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108271/astral-shift) to reduce the upfront damage.

When Fetid Devourer hits 50% health remaining, it gains [Fetid Frenzy](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262378/fetid-frenzy) which increases its damage dealt by 25% and damage received by 50% - this is likely when you will use Bloodlust / Heroism.  Be prepared to start spam healing tanks more often in this part of the fight as well as dealing with larger hits raidwide on [Shockwave Stomp ](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262288/shockwave-stomp)and [Malodorous Miasma](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262313/malodorous-miasma).


# TALENTS


![](http://ancestralguidance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fetidHtalent.png)

This talent setup provides us with the most single target healing possible while also bringing good burst AoE heals in the form of [Wellspring](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=197995/wellspring).  Since tanks are the primary targets of damage taken, [Earth Shield](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=974/earth-shield) is recommended as the majority of the fight will be spent healing tanks or other priority targets.


# HEALING TIPS





 	
  1. Rotate through healing cooldowns after each [Shockwave Stomp](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262288/shockwave-stomp).

 	
  2. Aim [Wellspring](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=197995/wellspring) after each [Shockwave Stomp](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=262288/shockwave-stomp) to try to hit the most people possible (usually aimed towards the boss to hit melee and tanks).

 	
  3. Avoid using [Chain Heal](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=1064/chain-heal) and [Healing Rain](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=73920/healing-rain) as most of your raid will be spread dealing with other mechanics in the fight.  Use [Healing Wave](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=77472/healing-wave) and [Healing Surge](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=188070/healing-surge) liberally while using [Riptide](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=61295/riptide) on cooldown to try to get as many [Tidal Waves](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=51564/tidal-waves) as possible.
