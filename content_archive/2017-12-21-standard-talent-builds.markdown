# Each Talent Explained




## Undulation


This talent becomes slightly more competitive with the addition of Tier 21's [4 piece bonus](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=252159). Unfortunately, the boosted heal has a tendency to overheal the target. It excels in low overheal environments or for debuff healing.


## Unleash Life


You almost always want to use this spell in conjunction with a [Riptide](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=61295) or a [Chain Heal](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1064). While competitive with both other options, it requires the most management in the tier and needs to be used effectively and constantly to maintain its edge. It is useful for constant raid damage as well as short interval burst damage.


## Torrent


Improves our spot healing on a frequently used spell. Very powerful for low to moderate spot healing, and has the additional boon of being a passive and requiring no micro managing. This is the default talent choice for this tier.


## Gust of Wind


Acts as a forward disengage. Useful for dodging low reaction time mechanics.


## Graceful Spirit


By doubling our theoretical up time on [Spiritwalker's Grace](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=79206), we are almost negating the effect that any movement will have on our ability to heal. This is the default talent choice for this tier.


## Wind Rush Totem


Acting similarly to [Stampeding Roar](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=77761/stampeding-roar), Windrush Totem gives the entire raid a burst of speed on a 2 minute cooldown. Useful for very tight movement requirements, but drastically gimps our personal mobility.


## Crashing Waves


What makes this talent excel in Mythic Plus acts as its downfall in raid. We rely almost solely on Tidal Waves empowered spells in Mythic Plus, but rarely use them in a raiding environment.


## Ancestral Guidance


Adds an additional burst to our healing that pairs incredibly well with [Cloudburst Totem](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=157153). This is the default talent choice for this tier for any raid encounter.


## Deluge


This talent is useless. It has no chance of competing, as it is the worst choice for Mythic Plus and significantly worse than Ancestral Guidance in raids.


## Ancestral Protection Totem


This talent has 2 main uses: A large raid cooldown for high damage phases and as a way to sacrifice raiders to avoid difficult mechanics.


## Earthen Shield Totem


A very efficient absorb that ise useful for dealing with ticking raid damage. This is the only option from this tier that appears on meters, so expect to see it on a good amount of logs, even when it isnâ€™t optimal.


## Ancestral Vigor


A strong passive that adds even more utility to our spells. This is the default talent choice for this tier.


## Bottomless Depths


The gain of mana must outweigh the healing from [CBT](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=157153) (roughly 12%). Unfortunately a very niche talent, but still good if you can make constant use of the mana return by spamming [Chain Heal](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1064).


## Cloudburst Totem


This is the default talent for us, in this tier. It has a great synergy with other talents, such as [Ancestral Guidance](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108281) and [Ascendance](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=114052). It also gives us a great boost to our burst healing, as it can be used as a "mini-revival" to quickly boost the raid's health after a spike.


## Echo of the Elements


[Echo of the elements](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108283) is much more common than [Bottomless Depths](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=197467). It provides many players with a nice quality of life buff, as having additional charges of abilities makes it less important to watch cooldowns like a hawk. In reality, [Echo of the elements](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108283) isn't taken because of any of that, it is taken because it provides us with more tools to spot heal with. [Echo of the elements](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=108283) allows you to effectively use your single target healing spells and reduces the amount of them do not feature a [Tidal Wave](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=51564) buff. It is great for fights like the Corporeal Realm of Desolate host, where the damage on the raid is low, but single targets will require attention.


## Ascendance


This talent hurts your sustained AoE healing in exchange for allowing you to have massive bursts in throughput on 3 minute intervals. Finds use on fights with large bursts and extended periods of down time.


## Wellspring


Allows for large bursts of healing. This allows for a slightly more spread healing than [Chain Heal](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1064), at the cost of sustained AoE healing from [High Tide](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=157154) and burst healing from [Ascendance](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=114052).


## High Tide


Useful for any amount of raid damage, sustained or burst. Is the default talent for the tier as it strengthens one of our core spells by a good amount, allowing us to deal with all types of damage patterns.
